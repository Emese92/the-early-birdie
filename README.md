### Design / Colour Scheme

The design of this website has a simple color scheme. Mostly black and white or gray that contrasts each other and makes the colorful pictures pop. 
It has different pictures of delicious breakfast dishes on many pages. 

The landing page has a nice eye catching picture with a welcome message. Next to the navigation bar there is the logo of a bird mathing for the name of the restaurant.
The main page also has a full width map, just above the social media links.

The menu is nice and simple just with a little boarding.

The My Bookings page is a just a list of bookings, with a green confirmation logo. It has an empty circle when it is not confirmed and a full green tick when it it is confirmed. The list rows are clickable, and they expand for one more line with extra information and also the edit and delete buttons.

The account pages all have similar design with different pictures, so does the add a new booking form. The forms use crispy forms.
