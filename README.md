# The Early Birdie

This website is for a breakfast restaurant. It has a simple contrast with the black and white colors and nice, colorful pictures. The user has the possibility to create an account where they can make and view their bookings for the restaurant. It is also possible to delete or edit their bookings. When the admin has confirmed their booking it is visible on their bookings too.

### Design / Colour Scheme

The design of this website has a simple color scheme. Mostly black and white or gray that contrasts each other and makes the colorful pictures pop. 
It has different pictures of delicious breakfast dishes on many pages. 

The landing page has a nice eye catching picture with a welcome message. Next to the navigation bar there is the logo of a bird mathing for the name of the restaurant.
The main page also has a full width map, just above the social media links.

The menu is nice and simple just with a little boarding.

The My Bookingd page is a just a list of bookings, with a colorful confirmatin logo. It has an empty circle when it is not confirmed and a full green tick when it it is confirmed. The list rows are clickable, and they expand for one more line with extra information and also the edit and delete buttons.

The authorization pages all have similar design with different pictures, so does the add a new booking form. The form uses crispy forms.
